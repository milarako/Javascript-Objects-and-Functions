### Function Constructor
- **prototype** property
- **new** operator
- **this** keyword

### Prototype Chain in the Console (*No Code*)
- hasOwnProperty()

- Object.create

### Primitives vs. Objects
- Primitives: strings, numbers, boolean, null and undefined
- Everything else is an object

### First Class Functions: Passing Functions as Arguments

### First Class Functions: Functions Returning Functions

### Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)
